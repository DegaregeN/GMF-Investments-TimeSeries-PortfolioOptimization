substantial daily losses. BND, a bond ETF, displays much lower volatility with a 5% VaR of -
0.51%, suitable for risk-averse investors seeking stability. SPY, an ETF that mirrors the S&P

the assetsâ€™ risk-adjusted returns, with TSLA and SPY showing positive ratios of 0.80 and 0.68,

performance may not be providing adequate returns relative to its risk.
